# Marain — Decision Archive

Per-round design-decision rationale. Each round's framing produces a slate of sub-decisions (lettered A-1, B-3, etc.); the slate's *what* lives in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §N.3 as a summary list, while the *why* / *alternatives considered* / *trade-offs* per decision live in this directory, one file per round.

## Protocol

When closing a round:

1. **Author the per-round file** at `tasks/decisions/RNN_<slug>.md` (e.g. `R13_functio_calls.md`). One H2 per decision, three lines per H2: `**Decision:**`, `**Why:**`, optionally `**Considered:**` / `**Result:**` / pattern links.
2. **Slim `ARCHITECTURE.md` §N.3** to a summary bullet list — one line per decision, naming the decision but not the rationale. First line of §N.3 links back to this file.
3. **Add an index entry below**, dated.
4. **Mid-implementation reframes and additions** count as decisions — extract them too, with `**Caught:**` / `**Cost:**` lines so the framing-quality signal survives.

Mechanically: a future-Claude reading `ARCHITECTURE.md` learns *what* was decided in one scroll; clicking into the per-round file recovers *why* without bloating ARCH for everyone who doesn't need the depth.

Rounds R1–R8 (foundation: crate layout, span model, error model, lexer, parser, codegen, CLI, testing harness) are backfill candidates — extract on demand when revisiting a round's rationale.
